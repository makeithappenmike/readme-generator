## Description
My main motivation was to complete the class project :) However, this was really fun. It helps to (at a minimum) provide the User with a starting point for a Readme. That's super useful because frankly, figuring out what to include can be a daunting task.

Check out an example video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rxNik6oWC8BTmMvqGdYN6OFxkk__Qmw/view?usp=sharing).

## Installation
Clone the repo > run ```npm install``` to intialize the included dependencies > run ```node index.js``` to begin taking input.

## Usage
Its a great starting point. Run the intial prompts and then take over manually for further editing!

In terms of what you'll be asked.. we ask for the following input:

1. Name
2. Github username
3. Email address (*uses validation*)
4. Project title (*uses validation*)
5. Description
6. Licensing (*this can be expanded in the future*)
7. Installation
8. Usage (*you are currently here :)*)
9. Contributing
10. Tests

After some formatting to keep things looking pretty, we will return a Readme containing all info that was input as well as some direct links to your email, Github, and and licensing included.
